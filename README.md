# Tandemloop-Technologies-Screening-Test

This repository contains my submission for the First Screening Test for the Full Stack Developer position at Tandemloop Technologies.  
All the problems are solved using the Java programming language.

As per the instructions, the project folder is named after me and contains separate Java files for each solution. It also includes class files that were generated during compilation.

Screening Test Questions :-

Problem-1: Create a small calculator which performs operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division using class.
  Calculator inputs :> ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘type of operation’
  Datatype :> ‘a’ = double, ‘b’ = double, ‘type of operation’ = string

Answer :- Problem1.java
 
Problem-2: With a single integer as the input, generate the following until a = x [series of numbers as shown in below examples]
 
  Output: (examples)
    1) input a = 1, then output : 1
    2) input a = 2, then output : 1, 3
    3) input a = 3, then output : 1, 3, 5
    4) input a = 4, then output : 1, 3, 5, 7
    .
    .
    5) input a = x, then output : 1, 3, 5, 7, .......
